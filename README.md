This is my CS50's final project,
I decided I want to build it in public as the idea was in the back of my mind for a while and it would be great to get some feedback while developing!

## The pitch:

Have you ever thought "Someone should make X or Y ?", but never had the time to make it yourself. well, this is where to post that thought and hopefuly someone will see it and and make that thing, I'm also thinking of adding gamification elements to it and provide some kind of reward to the 'builders'.

### Progress
I created a figma design for an MVP, and I'm currently implementing some of the UI elements in a React/Next.js app.

### Roadmap
1. Implement the MVP UI
2. Implement the backend and database
3. Implement the APIs in the frontend
4. Deploy

I'm going to update this readme as I go, stay tuned!
